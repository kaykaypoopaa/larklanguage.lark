# larklanguage.lark
Lark is my newest (and first!) programming language!
Lark includes built-in modules and other stuff like: print, random, pi. Some of the modules in lark are: math, random, string, array, and time!
If you or anyone you know wants it its simple, just read the instructions section below this text.

# INSTRUCTIONS
If you would like to use this programming language you need to make a folder in C:\ (so it doesnt get the registry mixed up) also, make sure thatr the folder is named LarkLanguage, next you need to get all the files from the repository and put them in the LarkLanguage folder, if you dont want to put it in C:\ then you can open the .reg file after getting it from the repo for the register-lark.reg (not the unregister-lark.reg) and change the path in the bottom to whatever path the bat file is located, after that, open the register-lark.reg file and then once it registers you should be set! to be sure you did everything right, when you open a .lark file it should output some stuff and then say test completed.


# IMPORTANT
if you dont have nodejs, you can install it at https://nodejs.org or if you dont feel like it, I'll try to provide a mediafire link or something so you can use the .exe instead of .js
